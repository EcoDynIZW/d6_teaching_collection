## Exercise 2.1

**Using data on green spaces in Berlin, estimate the number of wild boars observed inside green areas that are 1 ha or larger. What is the proportion of wild boars outside large green areas? Visualize the observations on a map showing the green spaces and the observations encoded by their location inside or outside the green spaces.**

Individual Steps:

* a. Store the simple feature data `sf_green` which is provided by the `{d6berlin}` package in a local object.
* b. Calculate the area for each green space polygon and filter for green spaces that are equal or greater than 1 ha.
* c. Load the wild boar data (`data_wb_melden_en.csv`) and turn it into a simple feature object. Remember to set the correct CRS!
* d. Intersect the wild boar data with the filtered green spaces and extract the number of unique observations.
* e. Use the new data to visualize observations inside and outside the green spaces that are 1 ha or larger as a map.

## Exercise 2.2

**Calculate the average distance (in km) from each wild boar observation to water.**

Individual Steps:

* a. Store the simple feature data `sf_water` in a local object. The data set is also provided by the `{d6berlin}` package.
* b. To ease the handling of the data set, filter for large water bodies only (area >= 100000 m^2).
* c. Calculate the distance between the wild boar data and the water bodies and add the information as a new column to your wild boar data set. Afterwards, convert the unit to km. 
* d. Calculate the mean of all estimated distances. 

Hint: To calculate the minimum distance per wild boar observation, you need to "union" all polygon features into a single multipolygon first! (otherwise you get all distances from all observations to every single polygon feature!)

## Exercise 2.3

*for the fast ones*

**What is the average and median distance (in km) to natural reserves...**  

* **a) for all wild boar observations?**  
* **b) for wild boars seen outside of nature reserves?**  

Hint: The information on nature reserves is contained in the green space data set. Check the help if you do not know what to look for.

## Exercise 2.4

*for the fast ones*

**What is the average distance (in km) to natural reserves that contain water bodies for all wild boar observations?**
