- $C$ is our actual count of individuals


- If we know our detection probability

### we can rewrite this into individual capture histories
(where 1 = detected, 0 =  not detected):

kableExtra::kable(
  data.frame(
  capture_history = c("10","01","11"),
  description = c("seen at first capture, not seen at second capture",
                  "seen at second capture, not seen at first capture",
                  "seen at first capture, seen at second capture"),
  prob. = c( "p1(1-p2)",
            "(1-p1)p2",
            "p1p2")),
  format='html'
)
```
--

### and re-write our formula to estimate population size:

$$\hat{N}=\displaystyle{\frac{n_{10}+n_{01}+n_{11}}{1 - (1-p_1) \times (1-p_2)}}$$
--

---
.pull-left[ 
In our example: $$\hat{N}=\displaystyle{\frac{n_{10}+n_{01}+n_{11}}{1 - (1-p_1) \times (1-p_2)}}$$ 



+ 1 bird captured only during first occasion:
$$1=Np_1(1-p_2)$$
+ 1 bird captured only during second occasion:
$$1=N(1-p_1)p_2$$
+ 2 birds captured during both occasions:
$$2=Np_1p_2$$
+ solving all 3 equations, we will get: $$N=\frac{9}{2}, p_1=\frac{2}{3},p_2=\frac{2}{3}$$

--

+ These are already 7 parameters to estimate  ( $\hat{N}$ + $p_{1}$ + $p_{2}$ + $p_{3}$ + $p_{4}$ + $p_{5}$ + $p_{6}$ )
--


+ solving our equation gets more challenging with more parameters and more field surveys
--

# heterogeneity in capture probability
--


+ detection probability can depend on behavior (e.g. trap-shy individuals avoid getting captured after captured once)
--


+ detection probability can depend on individual covariates (e.g. age, sex, infection status, etc.) 

+ mixture models that account for heterogeneity (Pledger 2000, Pledger 2003)
--

+ more complex models: Maximum-likelihood estimator and model selection based on AIC (Akaike information criterion)

# Relaxing the closure assumption
--

+ By relaxing our closure assumption, we can assess demographic parameters  
--


+ E.g. estimating survival ( $\phi_{i}$ ), i.e. an animal was marked at sampling occasion $i$, survives until sampling occasion $i + 1$ & is still part of the population (only for primary sampling occasions)
--

+ our detection probability $p$ is measured *at* individual sampling occasions, while our survival probability $\phi$ is measured between primary sampling occasions

# Cormack-Jolly-Seber assumptions

+ no tag-loss & individuals are recorded without error

+ capture is a random sample of the population

+ survival and recapture probabilities are homogeneous

---
# Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS)

+ survival $\phi$ varies between sampling intervals

+ detection $p$ varies between sampling occasions
--

+ The CJS likelihood is the probability of the data given the parameters:


$$L(data | parameters)$$
--

+ We estimate all parameters via maximum likelihood estimation:

$$L(parameters | data)$$

+ explanation of how maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) work: https://youtu.be/XepXtl9YKwc

class: inverse, middle, center

# covariates in CJS models

---
# Covariates in CJS

+ Often, we wish to explain heterogeneity in survival based on sex, age-class, social rank, etc. (i.e discrete covariates)
--


+ e.g. estimate survival based on social rank for each individual (low = 0, high = 1):

$$logit(\phi_{i}) = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2} rank_{i}$$ 

+ Here, we use the logit link function to estimate parameters on the probability scale (0,1)

--

+ $logit(\phi_{i}) = \beta_{1}$ is the survival for low-ranked individuals &

+ $logit(\phi_{i}) = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2}$ is the survival for high-ranked individuals
--

---
# Covariates in CJS

+ continuous covariates can be included (e.g. weight, size, etc):

$$logit(\phi_{i}) = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{i}$$ 
--

+ temporal covariates can be included (e.g. weather events, predator abundance, etc.):

$$logit(\phi_{t}) = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{t}$$ 
--

+ covariates can also vary with individual & time (e.g. age, body size, infection status)

+ in case of non-detection: model covariates (e.g. age) or use discrete values (e.g. discretized body size)

---
# Survival vs. apparent survival

+ we estimate **apparent survival**, because we can't distinguish between mortality & permanent emigration
--


+ apparent survival < true survival, because site-fidelity is almost never 1 (i.e. some individuals emigrate permanently or disperse)
--

+ to estimate **true survival**: 
  + add data about death events (e.g. ring recovery)
  + extend models (e.g. Multistate-Capture-recapture models that incorporate space)
