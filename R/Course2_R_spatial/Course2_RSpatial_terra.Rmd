# Introduction

Let me start with a big thanks to Cedric Scherer, Moritz Wenzler, Pierre Gras and Juergen
Niedballa who constantly helped to improve the course since its start in 2014! 
I am deeply indebted to you!

The course is intended to be a quick introduction to using R as a GIS. It builds
on the previous course, Course1_IntroR, and is written in such a way that you can
understand handling spatial data when knowing the basics of handling data.frames,
matrices and lists. There is no need to know tidyverse/dplyr coding style.

This course provides the basics for using the most important spatial
data types — vector (points, lines, polygons, aka ESRI shapefiles) and raster data.
In R, these are `Spatial*DataFrame` (the * can stand for *Points*, *Lines* or
*Polygons*, respectively, i.e. `SpatialPointsDataFrame`) or `RasterLayer` Objects.

Recently, `{sf}` objects have been developed to handle vector data more easily. The
latter can be treated like simple `data.frames`. Also the `{raster}` package is
under development — called `{terra}` package - the course is updated to use the
new `{terra}` package. 

The `{terra}` package provides the same functionality while merging some 
of the old classes and function names from the `{raster}` and being much faster. 
It is also especially useful for remote sensing data.

`{terra}` has a single class `SpatRaster` class for which raster has three 
(`RasterLayer`, `RasterStack`, `RasterBrick`). Likewise there is a single class 
for vector data `SpatVector` that replaces six `Spatial*` classes. Most
method names are the same, but note the following important differences in 
methods names with the `{raster}` package:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "functions-terra-raster.png"))
```

In addition to different data types, the course provides sections on coordinate
projections and the most important geospatial operations. Last but not least -
we plot a lot of maps to ease data visualisation and because it is fun.

The data we use stem from a longstanding project we run in Borneo. Please refer to
our website [https://ecodynizw.github.io/](https://ecodynizw.github.io/).
The project involves species conservation and large scale landscape planning. To

# Basics

## How to install...

```{r package-install}
pkgs <- c("terra", "stars", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rasterVis", "sf",  
          "ggplot2", "tmap", "viridis", "patchwork", "here", "units",
          "rnaturalearth", "osmdata", "elevatr")

## install packages that are not installed yet
## (not important to understand the following code, just run it)
unavailable <- setdiff(pkgs, rownames(installed.packages()))
install.packages(unavailable)
```

## ...and load packages

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
## when working with raster data
## do NOT load both packages terra and raster at the same time, 
## as this creates problems with the namespace 
library(terra) ## the "new" {raster} package
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(rasterVis)

## working with vector data
library(sf) ## the "new" {sp} package
library(stars)

## visualization
library(ggplot2)
library(tmap)
library(viridis) ## nice colour palettes
library(patchwork) ## to combine plots

library(units) ## handle measurement data
library(here) ## for easy directory management
```

## How to call help 

```{r helps, eval=FALSE}
## Information about a function or a package. If you do not understand some
## of the code below, always check the arguments and help of the function.
?terra

## search for an item:
??SpatialPolygons

## show the instructions of a package:
vignette(package = "sf") # vignette(package="sp")

## load the instruction of a package (embedded pdf):
vignette("sf1") # vignette("intro_sp")
```


```{r methods, eval=FALSE}
terra::plot # the :: provides the namespace, i.e. that the function is from the terra-package
showMethods(f = 'plot') ## S4 type method
methods(generic.function = 'plot') ## S3 type method
```

## Assign the workspace

Set your root directory, e.g. the directory under which you store everything
you need for this course, i.e. the data and the R-Scripts. You could name it
'TUB_BD_Course'.

Create the subfolders relative to root-folder. Please adjust to your setup. 
A possible folder structure could be: 
<br>

``` bash
├── TUB_BD_Course                   # root folder 
│   └── _DataBorneo                 # the Borneo data
│       └── BaseMaps                # geo data, found in _DataBorneo
│       └── BaseRecords             # animal observation data in _DataBorneo
│   └── R                           # store here all your scripts, i.e.
│       └── script_course1.R
│       └── script_course2.R
```
<br>

Traditionally, the working directory was hard coded, i.e. the full path was specified:

```{r wd, eval=1}
## adjust the working directory [wd]
getwd()  ## alternative fct

## Set your OWN root directory, the following is just an example of how to do it:
#root_wd <- setwd("C:/Users/kramer/PopDynIZW Dropbox/Steph Kramer/_GitHub")
```
<br>

This approach is error-prone and it complicates the cooperation with others as 
they have to update the working directory in every script they receive from you. 
(And if they don't change it back to your directory, you have to update it again...)

Nowadays, the best approach is to work with [R projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) 
that are associated with own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents. 

You can create a project in the RStudio IDE by using the `Create Project` command 
(available on the Projects menu and on the global toolbar). In our case, we want 
to create a project in an existing directory where there is already R code and 
data placed inside that said folder. Now, a hidden folder called `.Rproj.user` and 
most importantly a file called `your_porject.Rproj` should appear in your folder. 
Every time you want to work on your project, you open the Rstudio session by 
double-clicking that .Rproj file, which ensures that the root working directory 
is correctly set.


When using R projects, the package `{here}` is a handy helper: 

![Illustration here package by Allison Horst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/here.png)

> The goal of the `{here}` package is to enable easy file referencing in project-oriented workflows. In contrast to using `setwd()`, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, here uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.

The `here()` function from the `{here}` package searches for the `.Rproj` file and 
will allow you to construct relative paths easily within your project environment:

```{r here}
here::here()
here::dr_here()

root_wd <- here()
```

Now, we assign the path to these folders relative to the root directory:
<br>

``` bash
├── root_wd                    # TUB_BD_Course 
│   └── dbor_wd                #    _DataBorneo
│       └── maps_wd            #       BaseMaps
│       └── recs_wd            #       BaseRecords
```

```{r dirs}
## today, we start with Borneo

#dbor_wd     <- paste0(root_wd, "/", "_DataBorneo") ## the old way

dbor_wd     <- here("_DataBorneo")
  maps_wd   <- paste0(dbor_wd, "/BaseMaps") ## mind difference paste0() and paste()
  recs_wd   <- paste(dbor_wd, "/BaseRecords", sep = '')
```
<br>

Create an output folder where you can temporarily store your results (anything
you plot, create, want to save,....) with *dir.create*.

```{r output-wd}
#output_wd <- paste0(dirname(root_wd), "/", "output")
output_wd <- here("output")
if (!dir.exists(output_wd)) {dir.create(output_wd)}
```

Finally, your folder structure will look like this:

``` bash
├── TUB_BD_Course                   # root folder 
│   └── _DataBorneo                 # the Borneo data
│       └── BaseMaps                # geo data, found in _Data_Borneo
│       └── BaseRecords             # animal observation data in _Data_Borneo
│   └── R                           # store here all your scripts, i.e.
│       └── script_course1.R
│       └── script_course2.R
│   └── output                      # for any results/ plots,...
│   
│   └ <TUB_BD_course.Rproj>         # only in case you are working with an R-Project

```
<br>

## Access folder content

You will find a lot of bioclimatic raster files (.asc) as well as shapefiles in the *BaseMaps* folder:

```{r filenames}
filenames <- list.files(path = maps_wd)
head(x = filenames)
```
Should this be empty, then you have wrongly set the root directory and the data directory. Please check again how your folder structure looks like.

<br>

## Recap

**useful functions:**
<br>
`head()` : only shows the first 6 elements, i.e. if you have a large data frame, you can quickly check header and the first entries (analogously: `tail()` )
<br>
`paste(x, sep='')` : appends characters or numbers — great for working directories, loops across many maps or data.frames etc
<br>
**data formats and access:**
<br>
`data.frame()`  :  [row, column] or "dollar sign", i.e. mydata[1,2]: first row, second column, or `mydata$MyColumnName[1]`
<br>
`matrix()`  :  see above
<br>
`list()`    :  [[element]], i.e. `mylist[[1]]`. Attention! A list element can consist of a data.frame that you can then access like that: `mylist[[1]][1,2]`...
<br>
*S4-objects* (like spatial data)  :  access via `@`, i.e. `RasterLayer@data@values`

<br>

#  Raster data

## Data import 

First, load a raster map. Please check the description in the folder called
*DataDescription_Borneo.doc*. The file >*bio_asc_01.asc* is showing mean annual 
temperature * 10. Why?  Because it can be stored as integer, not floating type, 
which saves a lot of storage and memory.

```{r read-raster, eval=-1}
## read the ascii file as raster format
ras_bio_asc_01 <- rast(x = paste0(maps_wd, "/bio_asc_01.asc")) ## `raster()` with {raster}

## or use here:
ras_bio_asc_01 <- rast(x = here("_DataBorneo", "BaseMaps", "bio_asc_01.asc"))

Bor_mat <- ras_bio_asc_01  ## easy copying of whole maps
```
<br>

Now have a look at the object

```{r inspect-raster}
ras_bio_asc_01
```

What does the slot with extent tells you? Looks like decimal degrees, i.e. could be
latitude and longitude. However, the slot crs (crs stands for coordinate reference system)
is empty. That means, without knowing the reference system, the map cannot be
plotted at the exact location on the globe. Thus, when you get a map, always
make sure you also get the information of the coordinate reference system! If it 
is not yet set (because you import a raster map as a simple matrix or points from
a file), this is the first thing you should do!

```{r}
# str(ras_bio_asc_01) ## check this
crs(ras_bio_asc_01)   ## crs = coordinate reference system. If empty, assign it!
```
<br>

## Assign CRS

*Important!* Please read and repeat basic GIS-knowledge on coordinate reference 
systems (CRS), map projections, and geographic and projected coordinates.  

If a map already has a defined CRS, then you cannot simply overwrite this! To
transform the coordinates, e.g. angular coordinates of latitude/ longitude of WGS84, 
into a projected CRS with planar coordinates (e.g. meter distances, equal area of 
Lambert Azimuthal),
you need to *transform* it (see below chapter **Raster Projection**).

<br>
In the following, we assign the CRS only when no information is provided. This can be 
the case when you upload a map based on a simple data frame or matrix, i.e. when
it is not a spatial object.  
`crs(<raster>)` gives the information of the object (here: raster layer) `Bor_mat` or `ras_bio_asc_01`, and
is also used to set the CRS of the object via assignment (`crs(<raster>) <- <projection>`). 
Mind the spelling in small letters/ capitals! 

* `crs(<raster>)` shows coordinate reference system of a spatial object
* `crs(<raster>) <- <projection>` creates projection and sets arguments for CRS!

An easy way to specify the CRS is using the EPSG code, e.g. instead of
`"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"` use `"+init=epsg:4326"`.

See http://spatialreference.org/. The EPSG code for WGS84 is 4326.


```{r change-crs}
# many ways to assign the CRS, options listed below:
crs(ras_bio_asc_01) <- crs("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") 
crs(ras_bio_asc_01) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84" 
crs(ras_bio_asc_01) <- "+init=epsg:4326"
```
<br>

Projections can also be transferred from one object to another, 
but only when the CRS hasn't yet been specified.
In the following, load the topographic map (digital elevation model) of 
Borneo (`Bor_dem.asc` or `bio_asc_24.asc`) and assign it the same CRS as `Bor_mat`, 
because we know they are overlaying (you can check that with the raster extents):

```{r new-raster-import}
## ras_bio_asc_24 = DEM = digital elevation model
ras_bio_asc_24 <- rast(x = paste0(maps_wd, "/bio_asc_24.asc")) ## `raster()` in {raster} 
## or use here:
# ras_bio_asc_24 <- rast(x = here("_DataBorneo", "BaseMaps", "bio_asc_24.asc")) 
crs(ras_bio_asc_24)

crs(ras_bio_asc_24) <- crs(ras_bio_asc_01)
## same as: crs("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
```
<br>

### Quick plotting

There are different ways to plot a raster map. Below is a chapter on visualising
raster data, here I just give a very quick overview to get a first
impression of the data we work with.

The easy base plot:

```{r ras-base-plot}
## base plot
plot(x = ras_bio_asc_01)
```

(More plotting later!)

<br>

## Clip areas

We do this first to work with a small raster to save computation time. For this, 
we create a clip_extent based on the spatial coordinates. The command 'crop' then 
clips the raster map.

```{r, fig.height=5}
ext(x = ras_bio_asc_01) ## `extent()` with {raster}
clip_extent <- ext(117.2, 117.45, 5.4, 5.5)
ras_bio_asc_01_cr <- crop(x = ras_bio_asc_01, y = clip_extent)

plot(ras_bio_asc_01_cr, col = viridis::inferno(10))
```
<br>

## Accessing *RasterLayer*

First, have a look at the internal data structure
of the raster object:

```{r ras-data-structure}
ras_bio_asc_01_cr

## get additional information:
# str(ras_bio_asc_01_cr) 
# attributes(ras_bio_asc_01_cr) 
# class(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
```
<br>

There are many ways to retrieve internal data and access single bits of 
information:

```{r ras-data-structure-2}
ext(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)

xmin(ras_bio_asc_01_cr) ## or: xmin(ext(ras_bio_asc_01_cr))
ncol(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
head(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
crs(ras_bio_asc_01_cr) ## != CRS(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)

# crs = coordinate reference system defined
# CRS creates projection and takes args for crs!
# e.g. CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
```

```{r ras-data-structure-3}
## Retrieve internal data cont.:
nrow(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr) # ncell(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
dim(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr)  ## 12 rows, 30 columns, 1 z-dimension
res(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr)  ## resolution = cell size
```
<br>

An important function is `crds()` (`coordinates()` in the `{raster}` package), which returns the centroids of
each raster cell:

```{r centroid}
head(x = crds(ras_bio_asc_01_cr), n = 10) ## `coordinates()` in `{raster}`
```
<br>

## Terrain computation

We will now work with the digital elevation model (DEM) `ras_bio_asc_24` and create
a hillshade (3D look) based on topography using slope and aspect:
- simulates a 3D surface
- computes shaded relief values for a raster surface

```{r calculate-slope-aspect}
slope <- terrain(x = ras_bio_asc_24, v = "slope", unit = "radians", neighbors = 8) ## arg `v` called `opt` in {raster}
aspect <- terrain(x = ras_bio_asc_24, v = "aspect", unit = "radians", neighbors = 8) ## arg `v` called `opt` in {raster}
Bor_hs <- shade(slope, aspect, angle = 45, direction = 270) ## `hillShade()` in {raster}

## {raster} equivalent:
#slope <- terrain(x = ras_bio_asc_24, opt = "slope", unit = "radians", neighbors = 8)
#aspect <- terrain(x = ras_bio_asc_24, opt = "aspect", unit = "radians", neighbors = 8)
#Bor_hs <- hillShade(slope, aspect, angle = 45, direction = 270)
```
<br>

Let's plot the hillshade:

```{r plot-hillshade}
plot(Bor_hs, col = grey(0:100/100), legend = FALSE)
```
<br>

Other very useful terrain calculations are cost surfaces, cost distances
and least cost path, e.g. for corridor calculations. We will do that in
another course.
<br>

## Visualising rasters

Difference between *plot* and *image*

### `plot()`

*plot* keeps the proportion of the map / cells (e.g. squares here).

```{r plot-versus-image-1}
plot(x = ras_bio_asc_01, col = viridis::viridis(256))
# plot(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
```
<br>
However, if you plot several layers on top of each other, *plot* will not 
overlay them exactly, because the argument 'add' fails (example below). 
In that case, better use *image*, or any other plot function.

### `image()` (raster)

If you use *image*, the plotted proportions will be changed and skewed to the
plot surface.

```{r plot-versus-image-2}
image(x = ras_bio_asc_01)
# image(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
```
<br>

### `{tmap}` package

#### Static map

```{r ras-tmap-static}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")
tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_01) + tm_raster()
```
<br>

If you want to use a static map as high quality plots for your publication, 
save the output via `tmap_save()`. Make sure that the quality is sufficient by 
setting the dpi ("dots per inch") to at least 600.

```{r tmap-save-static-map}
tmap_mode("plot")

(m <- tm_shape(ras_bio_asc_01) +
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis",  title = "Mean annual temp"))

tmap_save(m, paste0(output_wd, "/BorneoMap_4326_tmap.png"), 
          units = "mm", width = 90, height = 90, dpi = 600)
```

The saved map: check output folder

```{r tmap-saved-plot, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("./output/BorneoMap_4326_tmap.png")
```
<br>

#### Interactive map  

```{r ras-tmap-interactive}
tmap_mode(mode = "view")
tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_01) + tm_raster(alpha=0.5)
```

Very good for checking the correct location of the data. Click on the + | - | layer 
icons on the upper left and zoom in or out and change the background layers. The
'alpha' argument makes the layer transparent. 

If you like, you can save the interactive map — check your output folder for the html 
file. Tip of the day: always save the epsg code of your crs at the end of
a spatial file.

```{r tmap-save-interactive-map}
tmap_mode("view")

(i.m <- tm_shape(ras_bio_asc_01) +
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis",  title = "Mean annual temp"))

tmap_save(i.m, paste0(output_wd,"/BorneoMAT_4326.html"))
## or use here: 
# tmap_save(i.m, here("output","BorneoMAT_4326.html"))
```

### `{ggplot2}` package

For advanced R-users: Beautiful plots can also be made with `{ggplot2}`; 
however, `RasterLayer` objects cannot directly be plotted, but have to be 
converted to a conventional data frame first.

```{r}
## Convert RasterLayer object to a data.frame
df_bio_asc_01  <- terra::as.data.frame(ras_bio_asc_01, xy = TRUE)
class(df_bio_asc_01)
head(df_bio_asc_01)

(g <- ggplot(data = df_bio_asc_01) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = bio_asc_01 / 10)) + ## correct Celsius
  coord_sf(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") + ## set correct projection 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "°C") + ## set custom colors
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude",
       title = "Mean annual temperature") +
  theme_minimal()) ## set custom plot style

## you could also transform the raster on the fly:
# ggplot(data = terra::as.data.frame(ras_bio_asc_01)) + ...
```

Alternatively, one can use the  [`{stars}` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/). 
(The [`{stars}` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) is another package 
aimed at working with spatial data, namely spatiotemporal arrays such as raster 
and vector data cubes). We first turn opur raster into a `stars` object and can 
then use the `geom_stars()` function in combination with `ggplot`:

```{r ras-ggplot-stars}
stars_bio_asc_01 <- st_as_stars(ras_bio_asc_01)
class(stars_bio_asc_01)

ggplot() +
  geom_stars(data = stars_bio_asc_01) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "°C * 10", na.value = "transparent") + ## set custom colors for NA
  coord_sf(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") + ## set correct projection 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude",
       title = "Mean annual temperature") +
  theme_minimal() ## set custom plot style
```
<br>

The nice thing about ggplot is the flexibility to customize your plot further. 
Thus it is very suitable to create static high-quality maps for publication 
which can be saved via `ggsave()`. Make sure that the quality is sufficient by 
setting the dpi ("dots per inch") to at least 600.

```{r ggplot-save}
g2 <- g + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
                plot.title.position = "plot",
                legend.position = c(0.2, 0.95),
                legend.direction = "horizontal",
                legend.key.width = unit(2.2, "lines"),
                legend.key.height = unit(0.7, "lines"))

ggsave(filename = paste0(output_wd, "/BorneoMap_4326_ggplot.png"),
       width = 8, height = 7, dpi = 600, bg = "white")
```

(`ggsave()` saves automatically the last ggplot. You can also specify a ggplot object via `plot = `).

The saved map: check output folder

```{r ggplot-saved-plot, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("./output/BorneoMap_4326_ggplot.png")
```
<br>


### Composite plots

#### Simple composite plot

Plot the hillshade (3D relief) and add temperature colours on top: alpha value 
gives semi-transparency. The extent is plotted as a red box, and the centroid coordinates of the raster
cells are plotted as points. 

```{r simple-composite-plot}
image(Bor_hs, col = grey(0:100/100))
image(ras_bio_asc_24, col = terrain.colors(25, alpha = 0.3), add = TRUE)
points(crds(ras_bio_asc_01_cr), cex = 0.1, pch = '+') 
plot(ext(ras_bio_asc_01_cr), add = TRUE, col = 'red')
```
<br>

Now open the image-plot with the zoom icon in a separate window and change the size.
You will see that the different layers are still plotted on top of each other.
<br>

Now do the same with the base plot function:

```{r simple-composite-plot-2}
plot(Bor_hs, col = grey(0:100/100), legend = FALSE)
plot(ras_bio_asc_24, col = terrain.colors(25, alpha = 0.3), add = TRUE)
points(crds(ras_bio_asc_01_cr), cex = 0.1, pch = '+')
plot(ext(ras_bio_asc_01_cr), add = TRUE, col = 'red')
```

You will see that zoom does not work here very well, the layers do not overlap any more. 
Nb: always use a specified plotting function for spatial data.


<br> <br>

#### Composite plot with `{tmap}`

In the following, we will create a `SpatialPointDataFrame` from the
small clipped/ cropped raster  with the `{sf}` package and plot it on top of the 
hillshade. Use the possibility of selecting/ disregarding different layers 
(layer icon on the left).

```{r points-sf}
hillsh <- Bor_hs

# make sf object from coordinates -> you will learn that also later
ras_bio_asc_01_cr_sf <- st_as_sf(
  data.frame(crds(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)), ## create dataframe of coordinates; `coordingates()` in {raster}
  coords = c("x", "y"), ## define columns for the coordinates
  crs = 4326, ## define crs, 4326 is the EPSG code
  sf_column_name = "geometry" ## sf needs a geometry column and you have to name it
)

# interactive plot
tmap_mode(mode = "view")

tm_shape(shp = hillsh, raster.downsample = TRUE)  +  
    tm_raster(palette = "Greys") +
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_24, raster.downsample = TRUE) + 
    tm_raster(palette = grDevices::topo.colors(20),alpha = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_01, raster.downsample = TRUE) + 
    tm_raster(palette = grDevices::rainbow(10), alpha = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_01_cr_sf) + 
  tm_dots(shape = 20, size = 0.01) 
```

What do the shape-arguments mean, e.g. `shape = 20`? Have a look here at the symbols:
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html?q=shape#sec:shape-spec
<br>

Unfortunately, in `{tmap}` you can only use `shape = 1` and `shape = 20`, 
only circles are plotted.
<br>


```{r static-sf-hillshade}
# static plot  
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")

tm_shape(shp = hillsh, raster.downsample = TRUE) + 
    tm_raster(palette = "Greys") +
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_24, raster.downsample = TRUE) +
    tm_raster(palette = grDevices::terrain.colors(10), alpha = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_01_cr_sf) + 
  tm_dots(shape = 1, size = 0.05) 
```
<br> <br>


### `persp()` (3D plot)

```{r 3d-plot}
# Cool 3D plots with rgl library, e.g. 'rgl.surface'
persp(x = ras_bio_asc_24, xlab = "Easting", ylab = "Northing",
      zlab = "elevation", r = 5, d = 1.5, expand = 0.1,
      ticktype = "detailed")
```
<br>

Why is the map so spiny? Check units! This is still a geographic crs, not a
projected one. The units are in degrees. Wait for the lecture for details.

<br>

## Raster projection

Project the grid (the small one!!) to have all units in meters:

```{r unit-meter}
Bor_dem_moll <- terra::project(ras_bio_asc_01_cr, "+proj=moll +lat_0=65 +lon_0=10") ## `projectRaster()` in {raster}

persp(Bor_dem_moll, xlab = "Easting", ylab = "Northing",
      zlab = "elevation", main = "Elevation model of Borneo",
      r = 1, d = 5.5, expand = 0.1, ticktype = "detailed")
```
<br>

## Raster Stacks

A raster stack is a collection of `RasterLayer` objects
with the same spatial extent and resolution, similar to a geodatabase. 
Go into the maps folder and check what is inside:

```{r raster-stacks-dir}
# gives names and full path of file
files.full <- list.files(path = maps_wd, pattern = '.asc$', full.names = TRUE)
# files.full # check also 
files.full[1:3]

# names only
files.rel <- list.files(path = maps_wd, pattern = '.asc$', full.names = FALSE)
files.rel[1:3]
```

<br>

### Working with stacks 

The advantage is, that you do not need to apply a command to each raster map 
separately, but can do it 'all in one'. E.g., We can set the crs of each 
single raster in just one line. In the following, we *stack* four maps in
a 'geodatabase' called 'predictors'. Check the .doc for a description of
the layers. In the following, we select 4 spatial layers, numbers 9, 12, 22 and 24.
The description of what they represent is in the data description document in the map folder. 
We load them all together with `terra::rast()`

```{r predictor-stack}
predictors <- rast(x = files.full[c(9, 12, 22, 24)]) ## `stack()` in {raster}
crs(predictors)
crs( predictors) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
```
<br>

A raster stack contains the single raster layers in a list:

```{r stack-list}
predictors[[1]] # this is a list! Address single layers with [[ ]]
# with {terra} you can also use $ syntax:
predictors$bio_asc_09
```
<br>

Plotting just one layer:

```{r plot-stack-one-layer}
plot(predictors$bio_asc_42)
#plot(predictors[[4]])
```

<br>

### Plotting stacks 

With base plot

```{r plot-full-stack-base}
plot(x = predictors)
```
<br>

With `{tmap}`: 

This is standardizing the legend to the min and max of all layers, which is 
problematic if maps are not in the same units. That's why you cannot see the
information in two of the maps:

```{r plot-full-stack-tmap}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")
tm_shape(shp = predictors) + tm_raster()
```
<br>

### Extract values from stacks

With the help of the `{rasVis}` package we can plot violin charts to visualize the summary statistics:

```{r violin-plot-predictors}
rasterVis::bwplot(x = predictors[[c(1, 2)]]) # bwplot(predictors)
## n.b. double [[ ]] because stack is a list of spatial rasters
```
<br>

Again, these do not look nice because of the different axis scaling.
<br>

For advanced users: More beautiful violin plots can be found in ggplot2. 
For this, we need to transform the RasterLayer data
into a data.frame first:

```{r violin-ggplot-prep}
## first omit NA values (which represent the ocean around Borneo)
raster_df <- na.omit(data.frame(values(predictors[[c(1,3)]])))

raster_names <- names(raster_df)
raster_ct    <- dim(raster_df)[1]
df2 <- data.frame(val = c(raster_df[,names(raster_df)[1]], 
                          raster_df[,names(raster_df)[2]]))
df2$grp <- rep(raster_names , each = raster_ct)
head(df2)

## take a random subsample of the data to not crash your PC when plotting:
a <- sample(x = nrow(df2), size = 1000, replace = FALSE) 
df3 <- df2[a,]
```

```{r violin-ggplot}
## a violin-box plot combination with raw data strips
p <- ggplot(data = df3, aes(x = grp, y = val)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width", fill = "grey85", color = "#3366FF", bw = 20) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.15, size = 0.8, outlier.color = NA) + ## remove outliers 
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.05, alpha = 0.2, size = 1.5, color = 'blue')

p
```
<br>

Since the units are so different, it makes more sense in this case 
to plot them separately, using a `facet_wrap()` and `scales = free`.

```{r violin-ggplot-facet}
p +
  facet_wrap(vars(grp), scales = "free") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = "none")  + ## remove axis ticks and labels on x
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) ## set custom plot style
 
# save the last plot
ggsave(paste0(output_wd, "/savedggplot.pdf"), width = 5, height = 5, dpi = 600)
## or use here:
# ggsave(here("output", "savedggplot.pdf"), width = 5, height = 5, dpi = 600)
```
<br>

...or plot them separately and combine them using the [`{patchwork}` package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/):

```{r violin-ggplot-patchwork}
df3_bio9 <- subset(df3, df3$grp == 'bio_asc_09')
df3_bio24 <- subset(df3, df3$grp == 'bio_asc_24')

p1 <- ggplot(data = df3_bio9, aes(x = grp, y = val)) +
      geom_violin(scale = "width", fill = "grey85", colour = "#3366FF") + 
      geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, size = 0.8, outlier.color = NA) + ## remove outliers 
      geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.05, alpha = 0.2, size = 1.5, colour = "#3366FF") +
      labs(x = NULL, y = "Value")

p2 <- ggplot(data = df3_bio24, aes(x = grp, y = val)) +
      geom_violin(scale = "width", fill = "grey85", colour = "#3366FF") + 
      geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, size = 0.8, outlier.color = NA) + ## remove outliers 
      geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.05, alpha = 0.2, size = 1.5, colour = "#3366FF") +
      labs(x = NULL, y = "")

## multipanel plot with {patchwork}
(p1 + p2) * theme_minimal(base_size = 15) ## apply custom style
```

Back to spatial R.
<br>

Retrieve metrics/ statistics from the rasters:

```{r metrics-raster}
#- Extract information from all rasters in one command
# cellStats(predictors, 'mean')
round(x = global(x = predictors, stat = 'mean'), digits = 2) ## `global()` -> `cellStats()` in {raster}
```
<br>

## Data export - saving raster data

Save the raster (not the plot...): There are many exchange formats for rasters. 
The best choice is considered to be GeoTiff, which also saves the projection and is smaller than 
ascii. However, for modelling e.g. in MaxEnt, the raster maps are needed in ascii-format.

```{r save-raster}
writeRaster(x = hillsh, 
            filename = paste0(output_wd,"/hillshade.asc"), 
            # or use here: here("output", "hillshade.asc")
            overwrite = TRUE, 
            NAflag = -9999)
```
<br>

## Manipulating rasters

Do any kind of raster algebra:

```{r manipulate-raster-calc}
new_ras <- ras_bio_asc_01 + ras_bio_asc_24 + 100
```
<br>

For changing cell size use aggregate() or resample():

```{r manipulate-raster-aggrgeate}
# collapse 20*20 cells into 1 using function 'mean':
ras_bio_asc_01_agg <- aggregate(x = ras_bio_asc_01, fact = 20, fun = mean) 
```
<br>

We finally plot the two new rasters next to each other:

```{r plot-manipulated-rasters}
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # recap from course 1: plots in 1 row and 2 columns
plot(x = new_ras, col = rev(rainbow(5)))
plot(ras_bio_asc_01_agg)
par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # remember to set it back to the default
```

<br>

### Change and query raster values

```{r change-raster-values}
# convert ras_bio_asc_01 to degree Celsius units (divide by 10)
range(values(ras_bio_asc_01), na.rm = TRUE)
mean.t.c <- ras_bio_asc_01 / 10
range(values(mean.t.c), na.rm = TRUE)
# find areas with mean annual temp >= 25 deg C
mean.t.c.25 <- mean.t.c >= 25
```
<br>

Have a look at the result using a binary plot:

```{r binary-plot}
plot(x = mean.t.c.25)
```
<br>

### Accessing cell values

Remember the function **`extract()`**. In the following, we extract from the
small raster the first three values (= cols 1-3; longitude or x-axis) 
at line 5 (= row 5; latitude or y-axis).

```{r accessing-raster-values}
cells <- cellFromRowCol(object = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, row = 5, col = 1:3)
cells    ## returns cell ID number, the index / rownumber!
extract(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, y = cells) ## returns cell values!
plot(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr)
## to plot the points on top, insert the 'cells' index into 
## the data frame of the coordinates of the RasterLayer object ras_bio_asc_01_cr
#points(x = crds(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)[cells,], col = "blue")
```
<br>
   
Extract raster values from all rasters at once (raster stack):
<br>

This is very important if you want to create your master table, i.e. based 
on the xy-coordinates of your species sightings (i.e. GPS point locations), 
you could extract the important environmental predictors at that location. 
<br>

We do that for an area in the center of Borneo. For this, we first get the
row and column indices of the center of the large Borneo map, e.g. `ras_bio_asc_01`, and
5 x 5 cells in addition, i.e. a square with an area of 5 km x 5 km:

```{r extract-raster-values}
center_x = floor(nrow(predictors) / 2) ## learn about the functions round(), 
center_y = floor(ncol(predictors) / 2) ##                 ceiling(), floor()
center_x; center_y

stack_cells <- cellFromRowCol(
  object = ras_bio_asc_01, 
  row = center_x:(center_x + 5), 
  col = center_y:(center_y + 5)
)

head(stack_cells) 
```
<br>

Why are these index numbers so large? Because the counting
starts at the upper left corner of the map and continues consecutively, i.e.
the data (`ras_bio_asc_01@data@values`) are one huge vector with length `nrow * ncol`!
<br>

```{r extract-raster-values-finally}
## finally, extract them:
pred_dat <- extract(predictors, stack_cells) 
head(pred_dat)

mastertable <- data.frame(stack_cells, pred_dat)
mastertable
```
<br>

Change raster values:

```{r change-raster-values-again}
xy <- xyFromCell(object = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, cell = cells) 

# coordinates(ras_bio_asc_01_cr)[cells,]
extract(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, y = xy)          
# extract(ras_bio_asc_01_cr, cells)

## Change values, e.g. for adding forest or creating a corridor
## take care! -> irreversible! better work on a copy!
copy_ras <- ras_bio_asc_01_cr
copy_ras[cells] <- 250
plot(x = copy_ras)
```
<br>

### Compute distance to points

```{r compute-distance}
## calculate distance
xy <- vect(xy) ## turn into SpatVector
my_dist <- distance(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, y = xy) ## `distanceFromPoints(object = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, xy = xy)` in {raster}
plot(x = my_dist) ## units?
points(xy)
```

```{r add-points-to-plot, fig.height=4.5}
## nicer plot adding the points from which a distance should be computed.
## please ignore the following 4 lines, you will learn that when 
## working with vector data below

xy_sf <- st_as_sf(x = xy, 
                  coords = c("x","y"),
                  crs = 4326,
                  sf_column_name = "geometry" ) 

tmap_mode(mode = "plot")

tm_shape(shp = my_dist) + 
    tm_raster(n = 100, palette = rev(grDevices::terrain.colors(100)),
              legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(shp = xy_sf) + 
  tm_dots(size = 1)
```
<br>

Calculate distance from many points:

```{r compute-distance-multiple}
cells1 <- c(cells, 250, 360) ## add two more points
xy <- vect(xyFromCell(ras_bio_asc_01_cr, cells1))
my_dist <- distance(x = ras_bio_asc_01_cr, y = xy)
plot(my_dist) #units?
```
<br>


# Vector data / shapefiles

## Polygons and lines

### Import shapefiles

Currently, there are two packages *sp* and *sf* (standing for simple features),
both with still important functionality. However, sf is much easier to use and handle. 
The suggestion currently is: [learn both!](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/03/should-i-learn-sf-or-sp-for-spatial-r-programming/)

In the following, the most important commands are provided for the sf-package,
and if necessary, also for the sp-package:

```{r sf-versus-sp}
## Border of countries and provinces of Borneo
## - only loading columns 1:3, 5, 7, 17, 18 of attribute table:
Borneo_shp <- st_read(dsn = maps_wd, layer = "borneo_admin")[, c(1:3, 5, 7, 17, 18)] 

## Protected areas (National Parks, Nature Reserves, Forest Reserves)
PA_shp     <-  st_read(dsn = maps_wd,
                       layer = "Bor_PA")[, c(1:4)]

## fix problematic polygons
PA_shp <- st_make_valid(PA_shp)

## main rivers
River_shp  <- st_read(dsn = maps_wd, layer = "sn_100000")

### the 'old' sp package would work with the `readOGR` command from the `{rgdal}` package:
Admin_shp <- readOGR(dsn = maps_wd, layer = "borneo_admin",)[,c(1:3,5,7,17,18)]
```

#### Transformations between simple feature '{sf}' and SpatialPolygonsDataFrame '{sp}'

```{r sf-versus-sp2}
## transformations
Admin_sf <- as(Admin_shp, "sf") ## from sp object to sf object 
Admin_sp <- as(Admin_sf, "Spatial") ## from sf to sp object
```
<br>

### Working with vector data

Accessing simple feature objects — easy handling, similar to `data.frames`:

```{r accessing-simple-features}
## Please note the similarity to accessing info from rasters.
str(object = ext(PA_shp)) ## `extent()` in {raster}
xmin(ext(PA_shp))
names(x = PA_shp) ## returns column names of a.t.
```
<br>

Accessing `SpatialPolygonsDataFrames` of the former {sp}-package:

```{r accessing-spatalpolygonsdataframe}
## Much more complex than sf-objects.
class(Admin_shp)
str(object = ext(Admin_shp))
xmin(ext(Admin_shp))
names(x = Admin_shp) ## returns column names of a.t.
```
<br>

Summarizing spatial information for each column of attribute table [a.t.]:

```{r summarize-spatial-data}
summary(object = PA_shp)
str(object = PA_shp)
PA_shp
attributes(x = PA_shp)
```
<br>

Have a look at the content:

```{r inspect-summary-table}
head(x = PA_shp)   
tail(x = PA_shp)
```
<br>

Retrieving information of a.t. — recap working with `data.frames` 
from `Day1_R-Intro` course.

```{r retrieve-information-summary-table-1}
PA_shp[1, ] ## returns first entry (row) of all 4 columns
```

```{r retrieve-information-summary-table-2}
PA_shp[, 2] ## returns summary of col only!
```

```{r retrieve-information-summary-table-3}
## PA_shp$NAME_ENG ## returns a long list  
head(x = PA_shp$NAME_ENG) ## using fct head() to only show the first 6 entries
```

```{r retrieve-information-summary-table-4}
PA_shp[1, 1] ## = PA_shp$SITE_ID[1]
PA_shp[2, 3] ## = PA_shp$COUNTRY[2]
```
<br>

The following returns the row indices of the data frame or a.t., respectively:

```{r retrieve-information-summary-table-5}
which(x = PA_shp$COUNTRY == 'Malaysia')
```
<br>

## Visualising vector data

### `{ggplot2}` package

You can use many packages, e.g. `{ggplot2}`, to plot `{sf}` objects:
https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html.

```{r ggplot-sf, fig.height=7.5}
ggplot(data = PA_shp) +
  geom_sf(fill = "chartreuse3", color = NA) + 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y =  "Latitude",
       title = "Protected areas") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) ## set custom plot style
```

Note that it does NOT work for `{sp}` objects (`SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`).
<br>

### `{tmap}` package

#### Static map

```{r tmap-sf, fig.height=7.5}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")
tm_shape(shp = PA_shp[, 1]) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "SITE_ID", palette = grDevices::terrain.colors(5))
```
<br>

#### Interactive map

```{r tmap-sf-interactive}
tmap_mode(mode = "view")
tm_shape(shp = PA_shp[, 1]) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "SITE_ID", palette = grDevices::terrain.colors(5))
```
<br>

### `plot()`

It is also possible to use a simple `plot()` function for `{sf}` objects. However, 
mind that this object has 7 columns, so each column holds information that will 
be plotted, i.e. you will plot 7 single plots. So do a little transformation:
either plot just one column, or define it as spatial:

```{r base-plot-sf-1, fig.height=7}
# plot(Borneo_shp) ## not run
plot(Borneo_shp[,1]) ## select column
```

```{r base-plot-sf-2}
plot(as(Borneo_shp, "Spatial")) ## plot geometry without information of a col
```

Now we illustrate how to plot objects created with the `{sp}` package.

Here, the basic plot function works:

```{r base-plot-sp, fig.height=9}
plot(Admin_sp)
```

### `spplot()` for `sp` Objects

There is also a special function for plotting `{sp}` objects. However, once 
again you need to select which information you want to plot.

```{r ssplot-sp, fig.height=9}
# spplot(Admin_sp) ## Don't do that! Each column of the a.t. will be plotted
head(Admin_sp)
spplot(Admin_sp[6]) ## only plot one of the geometries, coloured e.g. by shape_length = column 6
```

An one can use `{tmap}`. For example, we can plot a detail on the map — plot of
a single selected protected area:

```{r tmap-sp, fig.height=10.5}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")

tm_shape(shp = Borneo_shp) + 
    tm_polygons(border.col = "deepskyblue4") +
  tm_shape(PA_shp[,1]) + 
    tm_polygons(border.col = "black") +
  tm_shape(PA_shp[1, ]) + 
    tm_polygons(border.col = "red")
```

<br>

### Small exercises, and saving vector data

Simplify your life! Work with subsets, select Malaysia, save and plot as shapefile
with st_write():

```{r work-with-subsets, fig.height=10.5}
Mal_PA_shp <- subset(PA_shp, PA_shp$COUNTRY == 'Malaysia')

st_write(obj = Mal_PA_shp, 
         dsn = output_wd, 
         layer = 'ProtectedAreasMalaysia',
         driver = 'ESRI Shapefile', 
         delete_layer = TRUE)

tmap_mode(mode = "plot")
tm_shape(shp = Borneo_shp) + 
    tm_polygons(border.col = "blue") +
  tm_shape(shp = Mal_PA_shp) + 
    tm_polygons(col = "red")
```
<br>

Extract elevation per PA and save average to a.t. as a new column:

```{r extract-elevation-layer}
fewPA <- Mal_PA_shp[c(1:5), 1]
tmp <- extract(x = ras_bio_asc_24, y = vect(fewPA), xy = TRUE) ## returns a list — each element contains the elevation raster cells (ras_bio_asc_24)
str(tmp)
#lapply(tmp, FUN = summary)
```
Append mean elevation:
```{r appenad-mean-elevation}
## a bit complicated:
# fewPA$mean_elevation <- round(x = unlist(lapply(tmp, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE))) 

## ...or for now solved stepwise with aggregate()
mean_tmp <- aggregate(tmp$bio_asc_24, by = list(Category = tmp$ID), FUN = mean) 

## dplyr approach:
#mean_tmp <- dplyr::summarize(dplyr::group_by(tmp, ID), x = mean(bio_asc_24, na.rm = TRUE))

fewPA$mean_elevation <- mean_tmp$x
fewPA
```
<br>

## Geospatial calculation

Using the 'old' `{sp}` package and the `{rgeos}` package, commands for calculating 
properties of spatial objects were: `gArea()`, `gLength()`, `gDistance()`. 
Other often used GIS functions relate to basic spatial operations, such as
`gBuffer()`, `gCentroid()`, `gDifference()`, `gUnion()`, and `gIntersection()`, 
`gUnionCascaded()` (= dissolve function) and `gSimplify()`.
Spatial queries were `gIntersects()`, `gContains()`, `gIsValid()`.
http://www.nickeubank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RGIS2_MergingSpatialData_part2_GeometricManipulations.html. <br>

The new `{sf}` package has the same functionality, with functions starting with `st_`,
e.g. `st_buffer()`, `st_intersection()` etc.<br>
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html

<br>


## Spatial queries and transformations

### Area calculation
Returns the area in square meters:

```{r sf-area}
# st_area(x = Borneo_shp) ## returns long vector
head(st_area(x = Borneo_shp))
```
<br>

### CRS projection

If no CRS is assigned for a file, the CRS can be set with st_crs(). However, if a file 
has already a CRS, e.g. WGS84 (angular units, longitude and latitude), and you want to change into a projection with planar units (e.g. meters), use st_transform().

```{r sf-transform}
Borneo_shp_moll <-  st_transform(Borneo_shp, c("+proj=moll +datum=WGS84"))
class(Borneo_shp_moll) #sf object, data.frame!
```
<br>

```{r mollweide-tmap, fig.height=10}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")
tm_shape(shp = Borneo_shp_moll) + 
  tm_polygons(border.col = "blue") ## do you see the difference?
```

Note the change in the area calculation!

```{r area-mollweide}
head(st_area(x = Borneo_shp_moll)) ## units?
```

We can also use `{ggplot2}`:

```{r mollweide-ggplot, fig.height=9}
ggplot(Borneo_shp_moll) +
  geom_sf(color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) ## set custom plot style
```
<br><br>

Example: Area of Malaysia in Borneo

```{r area-bornep}
Mal_Borneo_shp <- subset(Borneo_shp_moll, Borneo_shp_moll$NAME_0 == 'Malaysia')
head(st_area(x = Mal_Borneo_shp) / 1000000) ## or / 1e6

## better: use set_units to change the units from m^2 to km^2
Mal_Borneo_shp$area <- units::set_units(x = st_area(x = Mal_Borneo_shp), value = km^2)
head(Mal_Borneo_shp$area)
```
<br>

Example: Calculate area of a polygon and add the area of a polygon as new column to a.t.

```{r area-polygon}
st_area(x = Borneo_shp_moll[3, ]) ## for a single polygon
head(st_area(x = Borneo_shp_moll, byid = TRUE)) ## for all polygons

area_km2 <- set_units(x = st_area(x = Borneo_shp_moll, byid = TRUE), value = km^2)
Borneo_shp_moll = data.frame(Borneo_shp_moll, area_km2)
head(x = Borneo_shp_moll)
```
<br>

The following for `{sp}` objects:  

```{r sp-area}
#gArea(Borneo_shp_moll, byid=TRUE) / 1e6 ## does not work, as Borneo_shp_moll is sf-object!
head(rgeos::gArea(Admin_sp, byid = TRUE) / 1e6) ## what does the warning message mean? -> check crs!
Admin_sp_moll <- spTransform(Admin_sp, c("+proj=moll +datum=WGS84"))
head(rgeos::gArea(Admin_sp_moll, byid = TRUE) / 1e6) ## now it works!
```
<br>

## Points

### Import spatial points

Usually, shapefiles come with a `.proj` file defining the projection, but not
always. Please always check whether the projection is set:

```{r check-projection}
pt_shp <- st_read(dsn = paste0(recs_wd, "/FCsim.shp"))
pt_shp  ## crs is missing!
st_crs(pt_shp) <- 4326 ## set it with command st_crs()
pt_shp
```

Spatial points are defined by two columns with x and y coordinates, can be 
imported as normal `data.frames` and then converted to spatial objects: 

```{r convert-df-to-spatial}
pt_file <- paste0(recs_wd, "/MyNewSpecies.csv")
df_recs <- read.table(file = pt_file, header = TRUE, sep = ',')
class(x = df_recs)
head(x = df_recs)
```

See below of how to convert a data.frame into a spatial `{sf}` object.
<br>

### Plot the points

Simple data frames with location information, as long as the coordinates are the same, 
can also be plotted in space. We first plot the polygon:

```{r plot-sf-points, fig.height=9}
plot(x = as(Borneo_shp, "Spatial"), col = 'grey', border = 'white') ## polygon
points(x = df_recs$long, df_recs$lat, cex = 0.5, pch = 15) ## simple d.f.! 
plot(x = as(pt_shp, "Spatial"), col = 'blue', add = TRUE) 
```
<br>

`{tmap}` can only handle spatial objects, so the data frame `df_recs` needs to 
be converted into an `{sf}` object first. 

You have to define which columns contain the coordinates via `coords = `:

```{r convert-df-to-sf}
recs_sf <- st_as_sf(x = data.frame(df_recs),
                    coords = c("long", "lat"),
                    crs = 4326,
                    sf_column_name = "geometry")
```
<br>

```{r plot-new-sf-object, fig.height=8}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")

tm_shape(shp = Borneo_shp) + 
    tm_polygons(col = "grey", border.col = "white") +
  tm_shape(shp = recs_sf) + 
    tm_dots(shape = 3, size = 0.25) +
  tm_shape(shp = pt_shp) + 
    tm_dots(col = "blue") 
```
<br>

## Spatial overlay

### Vector data

```{r spatial-overlay-1}
## retrieve the geometry (location) indices of PA_shp at
## the locations of sp_recs: which points are in PA_shp
nrow(recs_sf) ## 500
insidePA <- st_intersection(x = recs_sf, y = PA_shp)
nrow(insidePA) ## 11
```
<br>

### Vector and raster data interaction

```{r spatial-overlay-2}
# for a RASTER: extract mean ann. temp. from ras_bio_asc_01
# and add it to a.t.of the locations/ points
mean_t <- extract(x = ras_bio_asc_01, y = vect(recs_sf)) ## for {terra} we need to wrap the sf object into `vect()` 
recs_sf$mean_t <- mean_t$bio_asc_01
mean(x = recs_sf$mean_t) # hist(sp_recs_sf$mean_t)
```
<br>

### Saving vector data

Save as ESRI shapefile to import in any GIS

```{r save-vector-data}
st_write(obj = insidePA,
         dsn = output_wd, 
         layer = "inPA",
         driver = "ESRI Shapefile",
         delete_layer = TRUE)
```

# Data Sources

## `{rnaturalearth}`

[NaturalEarth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) (http://www.naturalearthdata.com) is a public domain map data set that features vector and raster data of physical and cultural properties. It is available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales.

[`{rnaturalearth}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rnaturalearth) (https://docs.ropensci.org/rnaturalearth) is an R package to hold and facilitate interaction with NaturalEarth (ne_...) map data. 

After loading the package, you can for example quickly access shapefiles of all countries that are already projected and can be stored as either `sp` or `sf` objects:

```{r data-rnaturalearth}
library(rnaturalearth)

## store as sp object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame)
world <- ne_countries() ## `returnclass = "sp"` by default
class(world)

## store as sf object (simple features)
world <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")
class(world)

sf::st_crs(world)[1]
```

This country data set (which is actually not downloaded but stored locally by installing the package) already contains several useful variables, mostly referring to different naming conventions (helpful when joining with other data sets), to identify continents and regions, and also some information on population size, GDP, and economy:

```{r names-world-rnaturalearth}
names(world)
```

We can quickly plot it:

```{r plot-world-rnaturalearth, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(world) + geom_sf(aes(fill = economy)) + theme_void()
```

You can specify the scale, category and type you want as in the examples below.

```{r glacier-rnaturalearth, fig.height=4.5, fig.show="hold"}
glacier_small <- ne_download(type = "glaciated_areas", category = "physical", 
                             scale = "small", returnclass = "sf")

glacier_large <- ne_download(type = "glaciated_areas", category = "physical", 
                             scale = "large", returnclass = "sf")

ggplot(glacier_small) + 
  geom_sf(color = "grey40", fill = "grey40") + 
  theme_void()

ggplot(glacier_large) + 
  geom_sf(color = "grey40", fill = "grey40") + 
  theme_void()
```

Relief data

```{r relief-rnaturalearth, fig.height=4.5}
relief <- ne_download(type = "MSR_50M", category = "raster",
                      scale = 50, returnclass = "sf")

plot(relief)
```

## `{osmdata}`

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world. The geodata underlying the maps is considered the primary output of the project and is accessible from R via the `{osmdata}` package.

We first need to define our query and limit it to a region. You can explore the features and tags (also available as information via OpenStreetMap directly).

```{r data-osmdata}
library(osmdata)

## explore features + tags
head(available_features())
head(available_tags("craft"))

## building the query, e.g. beekeepers
beekeeper_query <- 
  ## you can automatically retrieve a boudning box (pr specify one manually)
  getbb("Berlin") %>%
  ## build an Overpass query
  opq() %>%
  ## access particular feature
  add_osm_feature("craft", "beekeeper")
  
## download data
sf_beekeepers <- osmdata_sf(beekeeper_query)
```

Now we can investigate beekeepers in Berlin:

```{r plot-osmdata, fig.height=5.5}
names(sf_beekeepers)

head(sf_beekeepers$osm_points)

beekeper_locations <- sf_beekeepers$osm_points

ggplot(beekeper_locations) + 
  geom_sf(data = d6berlin::sf_berlin) +
  geom_sf(size = 2) +
  theme_void()
```

## `{elevatr}`

The [`{elevatr}`](https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr/) (https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr/) is an R package that provides access to elevation data from AWS Open Data Terrain Tiles and the Open Topography Global data sets API for raster digital elevation models (DEMs).

We first need to define a location or bounding box for our elevation data. This can either be a data frame or a spatial object. We use an `sf` object which holds the projection to be used when assessing the elevation data:

```{r bbox-elevatr, fig.height=4.5}
library(elevatr)

## manually specify corners of the bounding box of the US
bbox_usa <- data.frame(x = c(-125.0011, -66.9326), 
                   y = c(24.9493, 49.5904))

## turn into spatial, projected bounding box
sf_bbox_usa <- st_as_sf(bbox_usa, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)
```

Now we can download the elevation data with a specified resolution z (ranging from 1 to 14 with 1 being very coarse and 14 being very fine).

```{r data-plot-elevatr, fig.height=5.2}
elev_usa <- get_elev_raster(locations = sf_bbox_usa, z = 5)

plot(elev_usa)
```


# Advanced Map with `{tmap}`

At the end, a beautiful plot: 

```{r tmap-beauty, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}
tmap_mode(mode = "plot")

tm_shape(shp = hillsh) + 
  ## hillshading
  tm_raster(palette = "Greys",
            legend.show = FALSE, 
            alpha = 0.75) +
  ## topographical model
  tm_shape(shp = ras_bio_asc_24) + 
  tm_raster(palette = terrain.colors(25),
            alpha = 0.2, 
            legend.show = FALSE) +
  ## rivers
  tm_shape(shp = River_shp) + 
  tm_lines(col = "dodgerblue3") +
  ## protected areas
  tm_shape(shp = PA_shp) + 
  tm_polygons(border.col = "white", 
              alpha = 0) +
  ## locations
  tm_shape(shp = recs_sf) + 
  tm_dots(shape = 16, 
          size = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(shp = insidePA) + 
  tm_dots(col = "red",
          size = 1,
          shape = 3) +
  ## styling
  tm_layout(title = "END OF SESSION", 
            title.color = "darkgrey",
            title.position = c(0.05, 0.9),
            title.size = 2)
```

# <span class='exercise'>Exercise 1</span>

**Revisit the data set from course 1 on wild boar observations in Berlin: `data_wb_melden_en.csv`. Now, we want to study the spatial patterns of the wild boar observations. We may hypothesize that wild boar observations are also related to local differences in weather. Answer the following question using spatial data sets and visualizations:**

* **Question 1.1) Were wild boar with many piglets seen more often in warm parts of the city?**
* **Question 1.2) Were wild boars more often observed at colder spots of the city during sunny weather?**
* **Question 1.3) *Additional question for the fast ones:* Were large groups of wild boar more frequently seen in areas providing a dense tree cover?**

Follow these steps to answer the questions:

* a. Load the wild boar data (`data_wb_melden_en.csv`) and spatial data on temperature in Berlin (`summer_temp_100m_3035.asc` in `_DataBerlin`). Remember to set the correct CRS to the raster! (Hint: we need the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection for Europe.Tip: always save the CRS as EPSG code to the filename ;-) )
* b. Turn the wild boar data into a simple features object.  Remember to set the correct CRS (the wild boar locations were collected in WGS 84) and to transform it to the same CRS as the raster afterwards!
* c. Inspect both spatial data sets by plotting the temperature raster with the wild boar locations on top using the R basic plot function. The locations should match the map (if not something went wrong when setting the CRS; check if they are the same).
* d. Select one of the temperature layers and extract the values for each wild boar location. 
* e. Create a plot that visualizes the temperature at each wild boar observation (y axis) for each weather category (e.g. box plot or violin plot + raw data). 
* f. Create a new variable that holds the weather category as either "sunny" or "other".
* g. Visualize the temperature at each wild boar observation (y axis) for sunny and other weather (box and whisker plot + raw data). 
* h. Save the wild boar observations with the local temperature information as an .Rds file.

For the additional question: <br>

* i. Load the tree cover data set (`tree_cover_density_2012_100m_3035.asc` in `_DataBerlin`).
* j. Inspect the data set by plotting the raster using the R basic plot function.
* k. Extract the tree cover within a buffer of 100m around each wild boar location (hint: use the help to inspect the arguments of `extract()`). 
* l. Create a plot that shows the tree cover (y axis) based on the group size (box plot + raw data).
