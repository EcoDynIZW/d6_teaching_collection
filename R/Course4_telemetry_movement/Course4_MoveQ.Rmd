# Introduction

To start with, I would like to express my deep thanks to Cedric Scherer for his help in designing and ameliorating the course scripts. <br>

In this tutorial, we will show you how to get started with (real) animal movement data. 
To put it simple, animal movement data are just points in time and space, i.e. re-locations
of an individual that can be provided as a *data.frame* with four columns. An
identifier for the individual is only needed if you have various animals in one 
data set, i.e. if you have collared several individuals with the same collar or
already appended several data sets:

Identifier    | Timestamp           | x_coordinate    | y_coordinate    
------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------   
Fox_1         | 2022-01-01 08:10:04 | 13.47027        | 52.497802
Fox_1         | 2022-01-01 08:15:04 | 13.47015        | 52.497813


From [Course2_SpatialR](https://github.com/stephkramer/Course2_SpatialR), 
you might remember that such data sets can be imported 
as simple .txt or .csv files. Once you know in which coordinate reference system (CRS)
your coordinates are stemming from, you can **assign** it to the *data.frame*, thereby
you are creating a geo-referenced data set: a *SpatialPointsDataframe*-Object (if
you work with the R-package `{sp}`) or an *sf*-Object (with package `{sf}`). 
Looking at these x- and y-coordinates, you might remember that they look like 
angular units, e.g. decimal degrees, and the x-coordinate refers to longitude and 
the y-coordinate to latitude. Hence, we are dealing with EPSG-code 4326. 
Once you have imported and geo-referenced your data, you can plot and thoroughly check the data.

**Checking your data is a mandatory prerequisite** before any analysis (see 
[Zuur et al. 2010](https://dair.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Zuur_et_al-2010-Methods_in_Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf)). 
With your movement data, you might have outliers in space 
(e.g. when you test your collars in location A which might be hundreds of kilometers from your actual trapping site), your data might not have been regularly sampled because the animal was hiding and
there was no access to the satellite (weak GPS-signal) etc etc. This uneven 
sampling can affect calculations of speed, for example, and therefore a series of packages
have been developed to deal with those issues in movement data, like `{move}`. 

The most prominent movement analyses comprise **home range estimation**, calculations of
**habitat preference**, **behavioral analyses** (e.g. [Hertel et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13406)) and
detection of **movement syndromes** (personality differences) ([Michelangeli et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13616)).
Some of the packages listed in the next chapter are designed for these analyses. 

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE,results='hide'}

[TODO later - exchange Q with Caro's foxes for habitat selection, ref PhD C Scholz and paper by Schlaegel et al. in prep.]

```


In the following, we will step by step start with loading and exploring movement data
of the female red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) 'Q von Stralau', who had a small home range 
in Berlin, Germany. She was collared in January 2018 and had a very stable daily routine
as shown by 4 (20) min relocation intervals. Her location data are stored 
in the file with the tag number `tag5334_gps.txt`. For any details on the data please refer to [Kimmig (2021)](https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/32478) and [Scholz (2020)](https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/29984).

We will, however, only use the data of one month in this exercise, 
as data sets quickly get too big. Please note: the courses
[Course1_IntroR](https://github.com/stephkramer/Course1_IntroR) and [Course2_SpatialR](https://github.com/stephkramer/Course2_SpatialR) are 
obligatory for this tutorial.

# Getting started

To follow the tutorial, you can either clone or download the repository at
https://github.com/stephkramer/Course4_MoveQ
or you create your own R-project, copy the raw data and type the code chunks into an R-Script.
Please refer to the section on using R-projects in [Course2_RSpatial](https://github.com/stephkramer/Course2_SpatialR).

If you start with your own R-project, I strongly recommend to use the [`{d6}`-package](https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/d6) 
Cedric Scherer provided. This package automatically sets up the ideal folder structure:
https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/d6

In any case, the course folder has the following structure:  

```{text}
.
└── Course4_MoveQ         – (root folder)
    ├─── data-raw         – (contains the file with the GPS locations)
    ├─── docs
    ├─── output           – (contains the cleaned files and processed data)
    ├─── plots
    ├─── R                – (contains the R-script)
    └ Course4_MoveQ.Rproj – (the RStudio-Project file location)
```
<br>

## Necessary packages to install and load

We first have to install the packages and load them before we can use the
functions we need.

```{r}
## package names:
pkgs = c("here", "lubridate", "sf", "sp", "raster", "rgeos", "ggplot2", "tmap", "circular", "move", "adehabitatHR", "viridis", "devtools", "plotly") 

# install.packages(pkgs) # only run this line once! for installing the packages!
# update.packages()
```

**Tip of the day:** If you have already installed some of the packages above, you can
first check which ones are already installed, and save the ones *not installed* in 
an object called 'my_packages' and only install the missing ones:

```{r}
my_packages <- pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
my_packages
if(length(my_packages) > 0) install.packages(my_packages)
```

Now load the packages:

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(here)          ## for easy directory management
library(lubridate)     ## for date handling
library(sf)            ## for handling simple feature objects
library(sp)            ## for handling Spatial* objects
library(raster)        ## for handling raster objects
library(rgeos)         ## retiring end of 2023 -> use sf
library(ggplot2)       ## for nice static plots
library(tmap)          ## for nice interactive maps
library(circular)      ## for circular stats + plots
library(move)          ## for `move` objects
library(adehabitatHR)  ## adehabitatLT  #adehabitatMA                           
library(viridis)       ## for perceptually uniform color palettes
```

## Set the working environment

Now that we are working inside an R-project, we can use the easy functionality
of the `{here}` package, which is automatically pointing to your project's root
folder, e.g.:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here::here() 
```

Hence, there is no need to use the function `setwd()` any more.
Note: if it does not work, please close RStudio, go to your Explorer and 
double-click on the .Rproj file. Then, under 'files' (usually lower right panel) 
double-click on the R folder and open the script.

## Load data

The movement data are stored in the data-raw subfolder. Let's check which
files are available. 

```{r, results='hide'}
lf <- list.files(path = here("data-raw"), full.names = TRUE) 
lf
```

```{text}
## [1] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.cpg"
## [2] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.dbf"
## [3] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.prj"
## [4] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.qpj"
## [5] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.shp"
## [6] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/DieTiere_32633.shx"
## [7] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/geo-raw"           
## [8] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/KettleHoles.txt"   
## [9] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/tag5334_gps.txt" 
```

The output lists two results, there is another subfolder, and many files. E.g.,
the element 7 of the vector lf, `lf[7]`, is a folder. If
you already know that your movement data contains e.g. 'gps' in its name or
is stored as '.txt' or '.csv' files, you can directly search for those files with the
*pattern* argument:

```{r}
## check the difference, and note: full.names is set to FALSE
thefile <- list.files(path = here("data-raw"), pattern = "gps", full.names = FALSE)
thefile
```


```{r, results='hide'}
## ...and here to TRUE
thefullfile <- list.files(path = here("data-raw"), pattern = "gps", full.names = TRUE)
thefullfile
```

```{text2}
## [1] "C:/Users/admin/Course4_MoveQ/data-raw/tag5334_gps.txt"
```

Now load the data file. Our first fox filename should be `tag5334_gps.txt`,
which we stored under object 'thefullfilename'

```{r}
dat_anim <- read.table(file=thefullfile, header=TRUE, fill=TRUE, sep=',') 
```
<br>

# Data check and cleaning

## Checking for missing or incomplete information

Let's have a look at the data. This is the typical way data are stored on e-obs collars:

```{r}
dat_anim[1:5,] ## recap: head(dat_anim) also works
```

For now, we will only work with few columns. **`tag.serial.number`** refers to the 
individual identifier (collar ID). There are two columns with timestamps: 
**`start.timestamp`** is the preprogrammed time-interval. Then there is the
**`timestamp.of.fix`**, which is the real time the GPS-location was recorded. 
This is usually a bit later, i.e.<br>
( = **`start.timestamp`** + **`used.time.to.get.fix`** + 1 second), as it takes some
time for the collar unit to connect to the satellite. The spatial info is stored
in the columns **`longitude`** and **`latitude`**.

Before you can transform the *data.frame* `dat_anim` into a georeferenced 
spatial object, you need to check whether there are missing locations in your *data.frame*,
otherwise you will get an error message on transformation.<br><br>
**This can happen if no GPS-signal could be recorded. Or - importantly - some collars
are only activated when the animal is moving to save battery life. In that case,
the missing GPS coordinates would correspond with the last position (= be the same).
Depending on which analysis you want to do, e.g. define resting places, you might need to fill
the missing positions again.**

In our case, there are a lot of missing values in the locations:

```{r}
## if the latitude-entry is missing, the longitude value will also be missing
## so it is enough to only check the latitude
which(is.na(dat_anim$latitude))
```

Delete rows with missing spatial info:

```{r}
dat_anim_na <- dat_anim[!is.na(dat_anim$latitude),] ## alternatively, use complete.cases()
```

Make the crosscheck if there is missing info in a row in longitude. This should NOT be
the case after we had deleted those rows:

```{r}
which(is.na(dat_anim_na$longitude)) # none
```


## Checking for coarse spatial outliers

It could happen the collar was tested e.g. in Berlin, but the animal was finally
caught and collared far away. Make a quick check whether there are strange locations:

```{r}
plot(dat_anim_na$latitude ~ dat_anim_na$longitude)
```

There do not seem to be coarse outliers, data look compact. 


## Working with the date format

We will now add some additional columns, where separate days (numbered from 1 to
365), the month (from 1 to 12) and the hour of the day are stored (from 0 to 23). Sunset and sunrise can be calculated based on dates and the location (latitude, longitude). This can be 
done with the package `{lubridate}`. Check the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)!

```{r}
## have a look at the timestamp format, here the first row of the column start.timestamp
dat_anim_na$start.timestamp[1]

## define date-time format - the format is year-month-day_hour:min:sec:
dat_anim_na$start.timestamp <- ymd_hms(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp, tz="Europe/Berlin") 
dat_anim_na$start.timestamp[1]
```

Now append the information:

```{r}
dat_anim_na$yearday <- yday(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp)
dat_anim_na$month   <- month(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp)
dat_anim_na$hour    <- hour(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp)
dat_anim_na$kweek   <- week(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp)
dat_anim_na$date    <- date(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp)
## crosscheck with
# head(dat_anim_na)
```

In addition, we want to calculate the hours of sunset and sunrise as well as daylength.
For this, we need to install a package that is still under development, i.e.
which is not on CRAN. We therefore must download and install it locally:

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("bgctw/solartime") ## run only once to install package from GitHub
library(solartime)
```

For computing sunset and sunrise, the latitude and longitude must be provided as well:

```{r}
dat_anim_na$sunrise   <- computeSunriseHour(timestamp = dat_anim_na$start.timestamp,
                                            latDeg = dat_anim_na$latitude,
                                            longDeg = dat_anim_na$longitude)

dat_anim_na$sunset    <- computeSunsetHour(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp,
                                           dat_anim_na$latitude,
                                           dat_anim_na$longitude)

dat_anim_na$daylength <- computeDayLength(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp,dat_anim_na$latitude)

dat_anim_na$daytime   <- computeIsDayByLocation(dat_anim_na$start.timestamp,
                                                dat_anim_na$latitude,
                                                dat_anim_na$longitude)

## check new variables
# head(dat_anim_na)
hist(dat_anim_na$daylength)
unique(dat_anim_na$daytime) # gives the levels, i.e. 'TRUE' means daylight, 'FALSE' means nighttime and darkness
```


## Check for temporal outliers

Check if there are strange dates, or dates before you collared the animal (e.g., 
usually the collar is activated and tested before the animal is collared):

```{r}
table(dat_anim_na$date)
```

It might be easier to spot visually. We use the `{ggplot2}` package here as it recognizes and respects the date format:

```{r}
ggplot(dat_anim_na, aes(date)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw()

## compare with plot(table(dat_anim_na$date))
```

There is a strange date &rarr; **2025-12-26**! 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dat_anim_na, aes(date)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = date > ymd("2022-03-01"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = ymd("2025-12-26"), x = ymd("2025-12-26"), yend = 2, y = 25), 
               color = "red", size = 1.5, arrow = arrow()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#595959", "red"), guide = "none") +
  theme_bw()
```

Delete this data row:

```{r}
delme <- which(dat_anim_na$date == "2025-12-26")
dat_anim_na[delme,]                 ## check observation
dat_anim_na <- dat_anim_na[-delme,] ## delete the strange date and 
table(dat_anim_na$date)             ## check again
plot(table(dat_anim_na$date))       ## plot the number of fixes per day
```


## Save the cleaned file

Finally, we save the processed data file that we will use for exploration
and analysis into the subfolder `.../output/data-proc`. There are two options we can use:

* R data file - can only be opened/ read with R by using function readRDS()

```{r}
saveRDS(dat_anim_na, file = here("output", "data-proc", "tag5334_gps_proc.Rds"))
```

* interchange file format .csv

```{r}
write.csv(dat_anim_na, file = here("output", "data-proc", "tag5334_gps_proc.csv"))
```

Check your output folder for these files. The efficient '.Rds' file storage
is about 3 times smaller than the '.csv' file. 
<br>

# <span class='exercise'>Exercise 4.1</span>

**This is a recap from Course2. Please plot the animal relocations in two different 
colours based on the column `daytime`, using one of 
the options to create maps with `{ggplot2}`, `{ggpmap}`, `{leaflet}` or `{tmap}`.
Use the processed file of fox Q (*tag5334_gps_proc*) and do it in a separate script. 
Save your script as `Course4_Exercise1_*yourname*.R`.
<br><br>
Hint: Remember to load the relevant libraries.
Note that you might want to plot the locations in the correct
spatial dimensions by projecting it using the functions
`st_as_sf()` and `st_transform()`.**

<br><hr><br>


# Data exploration

## Load the cleaned data file

I recommend that you store the raw file safely and continue with
the cleaned and processed file after major data manipulations have been 
conducted to minimize errors. I'd even suggest to make these steps
in different R-scripts.

```{r}
anim_proc <- readRDS(file = here("output", "data-proc", "tag5334_gps_proc.Rds"))
# head(anim_proc)
```

Have a look whether there are gaps/ missing days in the data, or whether we have
approximately a regular number of fixes each day. We can use `{ggplot2}` to plot true dates:

```{r}
ggplot(anim_proc, aes(date)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw()

# mind: is the same as already plotted above:
# plot(table(anim_proc$date))
```

Now let's plot the *Julian day*, `yearday`:

```{r}
plot(table(anim_proc$yearday))  ## what is the difference to the plot above?
```

The number of fixes (locations taken) per day seems to be quite regular. Mind the 
difference when plotting per date (sorted) and yearday (1-365), irrespective
of the year.

## Plot activity

Now we can have a look at the distribution of the fixes during the day, which is
a hint on the active phase of the animal:

```{r}
plot(table(anim_proc$hour))   ## plot the number of fixes per hour
```

More fixes during the night - this is the active phase. As these are circular 
data, we can plot the number of fixes as sign for activity (knowing that our
collars did not record when foxes were inactive! Otherwise, we cannot distinguish
missing data from inactive times! -> bias). 

```{r}
## simple circular plot (rose diagram)
timetoplot <- circular(anim_proc$hour %% 24, ## convert to 24 hrs = bins
                       units = "hours", template = "clock24")

## Note: use namespace `circular::` here as there are multiple functions called `rose.diag()`
circular::rose.diag(timetoplot, bin = 24, col = "blue",
                    main = "Events by Hour (sqrt scale)", prop = 3)
```

Check whether the activity during the day was before sunrise (our 'daytime' 
column, which is either TRUE (=yes, daylight) or FALSE (dark hours):

```{r}
# with ggplot
# code adapted from https://gist.github.com/mattbaggott/4361381
ggplot(anim_proc, aes(x = hour,fill = daytime)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, color = "grey20") +
  coord_polar(start = -0.15) + ## to center setchange start
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", name = NULL, labels = c("Night", "Day")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Count", title = "Events by Time of the Day")

ggsave(filename = 'plot_activity.png', path=here('plots'), 
       width = 10, height = 10, units = "cm")
```

Apart from the outliers between 11 and 13 o'clock, the active phase was
during the dark hours.

```{r,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# TODO under development: heatmap as activity plot #
anim_proc_plot <- anim_proc
anim_proc_plot$count <- 1 ## count observations per hour
anim_proc_plot <- aggregate(anim_proc_plot$count, by = list(kweek = anim_proc_plot$kweek, hour = anim_proc_plot$hour), FUN = sum)

ggplot(anim_proc_plot, aes(x = kweek, y = hour, fill = x)) +
  geom_tile() +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```


```{r,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Let's fix the yearly split (we could also work with dates but take a manual route here):
# continued from above - activity as heatmap 
anim_proc_plot$kweek_adj <- ifelse(anim_proc_plot$kweek < 40, max(anim_proc_plot$kweek) + anim_proc_plot$kweek, anim_proc_plot$kweek)

ggplot(anim_proc_plot, aes(x = kweek_adj, y = hour, fill = x)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size = .5) +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(44, 53, 58), labels = c("44/2018", "53/2018", "5/2019")) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket", direction = -1, name = "Observations") +
  labs(x = "Week/Year", y = "Hour of the Day") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

## Convert the data into a spatial object

Now we transform the data into `sf` and `sp` objects and **assign** 
the coordinate reference system:

```{r}
# transform into spatial simple feature sf object
mydf_sf <- st_as_sf(x = data.frame(anim_proc),
                       coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                       crs = 4326,
                       sf_column_name = "geometry" )

# transform into SpatialPointsDataFrame  - for crosschecking
mydf_sp <- as(mydf_sf, "Spatial") 
```

And then we **project** the reference system from angular units to a planar
coordinate reference system in meters:

```{r}
# transform CRS to projected one in meter distance units
mydf_sf_trans <-  st_transform(mydf_sf, 3035 )  # EPSG-code  
mydf_sp_trans <-  spTransform(mydf_sp, CRS("+init=epsg:3035")) 
```

Recently, there are issues with the missing datum in the CRS-specifications. We
ignore this for now. More on the issue of moving from proj4 to proj6 in the future: <br>
* https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_crs_coding/<br>
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/vignettes/CRS_warnings.html<br>

**Make a quick plot of the data**

Recap for styling the plot:<br>
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/12/introduction-to-geospatial-visualization-with-the-tmap-package/

```{r}
tmap_mode(mode = "view")

tm_shape(shp = mydf_sf_trans) + 
  tm_dots(size = 0.01, 
          col = "daytime",  
          alpha = 0.5)
```

Have a deep look at the data: did the fox really swim? (points in Lake Rummelsburg).
Or are these outliers? No: the lake was frozen - check the date! Note: you really need to know your animals and the area before analysing data!
<br>

```{r,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# TODO later - access date of the outlier and check ambient temperature 
```

# Basic movement metrics

## Transform your data into a `{move}` object

Check here for the possibilities of what to do with the package:

* https://rdrr.io/cran/move/f/vignettes/move.Rmd <br>

Because we are dealing with spatial measures (e.g. area, distance, perimeter,...),
I recommend to work with projected coordinates. To create a move-object,
the coordinates of the projected CRS need to be appended to a data.frame:
```{r}
## assign columns with coordinates to use later in data frame
mydf_sf_trans$X_3035 <- st_coordinates(mydf_sf_trans)[,1]
mydf_sf_trans$Y_3035 <- st_coordinates(mydf_sf_trans)[,2]

## new object as data frame
anim_for_move <- st_drop_geometry(mydf_sf_trans) 

## now turn into move object
my_fox <- move(x = anim_for_move$X_3035, y = anim_for_move$Y_3035,
               time = as.POSIXct(anim_for_move$start.timestamp, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
               proj = CRS("+init=epsg:3035"),
               data = anim_for_move,
               animal = "FoxQvonStralau")  
```


```{r}
## Alternative using data.frame with longitude-latitude columns
# my_fox <- move(x = anim_proc$longitude, y = anim_proc$latitude,
#                time=as.POSIXct(anim_proc$start.timestamp,format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
#                proj= CRS("+init=epsg:4326"),
#                data=anim_proc,
#                animal="FoxQvonStralau")  
# head(my_fox); nrow(my_fox)
```

## Time lag, turning angle and speed

### Time lags between the fixes:

```{r}
timeLag(my_fox, unit = "mins")[1:5] ## varies a lot, but minimum here 20 min
min(timeLag(my_fox, units = "mins"))
mean(timeLag(my_fox, units = "mins"))
max(timeLag(my_fox, units = "mins"))
```

### Turning angles:

The calculation of turning angles only makes sense with very high resolution data. 
With 20 min intervals between fixes, turning angles do not make much sense any more,
as the animals can have turned and moved a lot in between.

```{r}
turnang <- angle(my_fox)
# turnang <- turnAngleGc(my_fox) # the same
# using the absolute abs(), because -180 and 180 has similar meaning:
# the animal keeps the direction
hist(abs(turnang))
```

### Speed and step length:

```{r}
steplength <- distance(my_fox) ## know your units!
hist(steplength)
max(steplength) ## max 1 km in 20 min = 3 km / h

hist(speed(my_fox)) ## units? -> check ?speed
```

# The homerange concept - MCP, kernel, aKDE


See lecture!


### Minimum Convex Polygon

Unfortunately, we have to use `SpatialDataFrame`-Objects for activity range 
calculation, as the package `{adehabitatHR}` is based on the old `sp` format.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
# TODO - something is wrong here with the units despite using projected CRS 
# !!!! check the crs warning online
hrBootstrap(my_fox, rep = 5, level = 99, unout= 'km2', plot = TRUE) # units still wrong
```

You can calculate the total area covered, or, if you specify a column, you
can calculate the activity range per daytime, animalID or months... Use the 
`SpatialDataFrame`-Object from the `{sp}` package we created above.

```{r}
mcp_daytime <- mcp(mydf_sp_trans[,'daytime'], percent = 95, unout = "km2") # MCP (95%) 
mcp_daytime ## area for both (daytime separated) polygons
```
The daytime activity (or better: hiding and resting) range is ten times smaller 
than the nighttime activity. During the active nighttime, fox Q uses ~ 0.5 km2, 
while during the day the range is restricted to 600 ha. 
<br>
The following plot shows the increase of the area for different MCP-levels:

```{r}
hrs <- mcp.area(mydf_sp_trans[,'daytime'], percent = seq(50, 100, by = 5), unout = "km2")
hrs ## home range size in km2 for the different MCP-levels
```

And that's how it looks:
```{r}
plot(mcp_daytime)
plot(mydf_sp_trans, add=TRUE, col= as.numeric(mydf_sp_trans$daytime)+1)
```



```{r}
mcp_month <- mcp(mydf_sp_trans[,'month'], percent = 95, unout = "km2") ## MCP (95%) 
mcp_month
```

Note that there is an activity range calculated for October (month 10), but the animal was only collared  30.10.! This definitely does not make sense.
<br>
Now save the MCPs as ESRI shapefiles. Mind: the object is a *SpatialPolygonsDataFrame*
object from the '{sp}'-package; hence use writeOGR():

```{r}
writeOGR(mcp_daytime, dsn = here("output", "data-proc"), 
         "mcp95_daytime_foxQ", "ESRI Shapefile", overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Kernel utility density

Calculate the density kernel:

```{r}
## calculate kernel with h = "href", i.e. default smoothing
kud <- kernelUD(mydf_sp_trans[,'daytime'], h = "href") 
# the output is an object with lists, accessed via: str(kud)
kernel.area(kud, unout = "km2") ## across all levels 5-95%
```
The area sizes are similar to the MCP95 values, however the daytime activity range
is twice as large.

Now, we create a contour line of the 90% KUD to export as shapefile:
```{r}
kud90 <- getverticeshr(kud, percent = 90) ## this creates the spatial object, units m2 
gArea(kud90, byid = TRUE)/ 1e6            ## units km2
```

Make a plot and save it as spatial polygon:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
## This plot is too ugly
# plot only the nighttime
image(kud[[1]], col = viridis(100, direction = -1))
xyz <- as.image.SpatialGridDataFrame(kud[[1]])
contour(xyz, add = TRUE)
points(mydf_sp_trans, cex = 0.01, col = "red")
```


```{r}
# save it as shapefile - mind - here we can only save one contour line, 
# in this case the 90% kernel:
writeOGR(kud90, dsn = here("output","data-proc"), 
         layer = "kernel_ud90", "ESRI Shapefile", overwrite = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# make the crosscheck: load and plot
kernel_ud90_sf <- st_read(dsn = here("output", "data-proc"), layer = "kernel_ud90")
mcp95_sf       <- st_read(dsn = here("output", "data-proc"), layer = "mcp95_daytime_foxQ")
# note: the CRS is lost and not defined! So assign it again:
st_crs(kernel_ud90_sf) <- 3035
st_crs(mcp95_sf)       <- 3035
```


```{r, fig.height=8}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = kernel_ud90_sf, aes(fill = id)) +
  geom_sf(data = mydf_sf_trans, size = 1.5, alpha = .1, color = "red3") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey70"), guide = "none") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

Do the following only on a fast computer:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
##### der krass coole 3D plot ####
## code adapted from

# devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
